# Future

Knowledge-driven prediction research and specialized computational engines. Traditional procedures and interpretations are separate from evidence of predictive accuracy.

The immutable workbook in `resources/` is the taxonomy authority. `knowledge/inventory.json` preserves all six worksheets; `inventory_audit.json` records structural checks; `gaps.json` tracks the initial ordered gap pass. Curated source research is separate in `sources.json` so provisional rankings are never silently rewritten.

## Reproduce the inventory audit

Python 3.11+:

```powershell
python -m pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
python scripts/import_inventory.py
```

The evolving knowledge base is a permanent asset: source records, scoped versioned rules, examples and relationships remain independently reusable by future engines. Start with JSON and SQLite full-text retrieval. Add semantic retrieval only after measuring a need. Engines own calculations; retrieval supplies provenance and interpretation context.

See `PROGRESS.md` for implemented scope and the next action. No complete prediction engine is available yet.
